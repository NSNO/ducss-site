			<p>The Dublin University Computer Science Society is Trinity's student society dedicated to the organisation and promoting of events related to computing, computer science and interactive entertainment technology. We do so through our weekly events, which can range from talks, workshops and tutorials to gaming competitions and regular nights out. We're the proud residents of a kick-ass room in Trinity's Hamilton building, in which we have a big HD TV hooked up to games consoles, 4 high-specced PCs ready to play the latest games as well as comfy couches and chairs to relax in (these are particularly useful the morning after our aforementioned nights out). We offer shell and intersocs IRC access, storage and hosting on our Linux servers which are accessible both inside and outside college. Our room has a well-stocked library with books on mathematics, games development, hardware and general Computer Science. As well as our regular social events, we run the Computer Science Christmas Party every year too.</p>

			<p>New website coming soon, but see you in Front Square during Fresher's Week.</p>

			<p>You can contact us at <a href='mailto:ducss@csc.tcd.ie'>ducss@csc.tcd.ie</a>, in #ducss and #ducss-com on intersocs IRC or in our room in the Hamilton. Or if you're a social-networky type, find us on <a href='https://www.facebook.com/groups/5813747845/?fref=ts'>Facebook</a> or on Twitter at <a href='https://twitter.com/ducss'>@ducss</a>.<p>
